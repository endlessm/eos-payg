eos-payg
========

eos-payg implements pay-as-you-go support for EOS, providing a way to verify
top-up codes and monitor the amount of time the computer has remaining before
the user next needs to top up its lease.

It provides a daemon to monitor the expiry time for the current code and to
verify new codes, a command line utility for generating new codes, and various
helper libraries.

All the library APIs are currently unstable and are likely to change wildly.
