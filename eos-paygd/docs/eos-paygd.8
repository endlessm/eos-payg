\fBeos\-paygd [\-a \fPbus\-address\fB]
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
.\"
\fBeos\-paygd\fP is a manager for the pay as you go state of the system. It
tracks the expiry time of the current pay as you go code, and signals to lock
the system when that expiry time is reached. It allows new pay as you go codes
to be validated and added, causing the expiry time to be extended.
.PP
\fBeos\-paygd\fP is designed to be run by \fBsystemd\fP(1), being
D\-Bus activated. There should be no need to run \fBeos\-paygd\fP
manually. Use the gnome\-shell UI to add codes to extend the expiry time.
