    This can be run when installed or uninstalled. When uninstalled, it
    requires G_TEST_BUILDDIR and G_TEST_SRCDIR to be set. It can run as any
    user, although running as root will result in most of the tests being
    skipped, as eos-paygd1 aborts when run as root on principle of least
    privilege.

    The idea with this test harness is to simulate simple integration
    situations for eos-paygd1, rather than to test any of the core code
    in depth. Unit tests exist for that.
