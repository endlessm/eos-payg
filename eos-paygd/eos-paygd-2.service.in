# We used to start earlier in an effort to reduce the chance the user is dropped to a
# shell before we started - but that leaves us with a weird race condition that can
# sometimes lead to chroot()ing to a place where dbus doesn't exist.
#
# initrd-parse-etc.service appears to be the place where untrusted actions start, as
# fstab mounts with the x-initrd.mount option happen shortly afterwards. We need to
# ensure we start before that point.
#
# This puts us starting after the main fs has been checked, so there's a chance to
# drop to a root shell before eos-paygd starts. We'll have to solve that somewhere
# else for now.
