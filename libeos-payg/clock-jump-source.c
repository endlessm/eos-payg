 * epg_clock_jump_source_new:
 * @error: return location for a #GError, or %NULL
 *
 * This creates a #GSource that will dispatch when the system clock jumps
 * (changes discontinously) which can happen for example when the user sets it
 * or NTP adjusts it. This is accomplished using the TFD_TIMER_CANCEL_ON_SET
 * flag supported by timerfd_settime().
 *
 * There is an unlikely race here: if the clock jumps while this function is
 * executing but before the timerfd is set up, that jump will be missed.
 *
 * @error will be set to a #GIOError if, for example, the process runs out
 * of file descriptors.
 *
 * Returns: (transfer full): a new #GSource, or %NULL with @error set
 * Since: 0.2.2
